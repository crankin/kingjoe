<h2>About</h2>

<h3>DATELINE :</h3>
<p>5° 466’ N. //  158° 65’ W
636 nautical miles south of O’ahu
456 nm north of Kiritimati</p>
<h3>Who:</h3>
<p>Marc English, designer/educator/artist/author</p>
<h3>What:</h3>
<p>Currently, under sail on the Sea Dragon, 98’ exploratory vessel. Along with three other passengers, four crew. They head for Tahiti. I get dropped off on Kiritimati.</p>
<h3>When:</h3>
<p>Right now.
February - May 2023, and beyond.</p>
<h3>Why;</h3>
<p>In 1919, English’s grandfather, Joe English, was rescued by Admiral Lord Jellicoe, HM Royal Navy after being marooned on the world’s largest coral atoll, due to the Spanish Flu pandemic.</p>
<p>For decades grandson Marc has been entrusted with the family artifacts: grandfather’s photos from 1916 – 2919; copies of his correspondence; details on the cultivation of coconuts (Joe managed  the Central Pacific  Coconut Plantation on the island, barely above the equator, halfway between Hawaii and Tahiti); and the plantation manager’s journal, outlining the contract laborer’s mutiny and attempted murder of Joe.</p>
<p>Now, the younger English – old enough to be grandfather himself – arrives to learn more about the island; the overlapping cultures of the Missionary Catholic and Protestant colonizers; and South Pacific, France, the British Empire, and the United States around which a now-multinational corporation (Unilever) are connected;  the Great War; and a 29-year-old man from outside Boston who has found him all but alone on a desert island – using a false name.</p>
<h3>How:</h3>
<p>Now, delayed by another pandemic, the grandson arrives back to Christmas Island — now Kiritimati – as did his grandfather, under sail, upon 20’ seas and all but Gale winds.</p>
<p>Now, with cameras, watercolor and sketch pads, empty notebooks, gifts for the locals, he will spend two months revisiting London, Paris, Algeria, Poland – all named by the defrocked French missionary turned millionaire who leased the island – the debris-steern shore of the Bay of Wrecks, and finally stand upon the lone 6’ high point of Kiritimati. called “Joe’s Hill,” where a man hiding his past and once boxing champ of the US Navy’s Atlantic fleet, declared himself King of Christmas Island.</p>

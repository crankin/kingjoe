Copy loaned to me by John Bryden, 79, of Scotland. Has been in the Pacific since 1966, age 23. Then managed copra plantation here on Christmas Island for nine years. Quit when striking workers were not honored. Has lived all over the Pacific, owns the largest trading store (JMB) on the island (and a couple mini JMBs). Married a woman born on Christmas Island. Two sons, schooled in Scotland, have a wee lilt — and parlance — of Scotsmen.

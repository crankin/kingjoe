Yesterday I heard for the first time — and it’s as close to a confirmation as I yet have — the first flight to this island, on Fiji Air, will be on 2 May.

The departure ticket I bought back in January, was for 3 May. It looks like I will be the first “tourist” or “traveler” to leave this island via plane since the pandemic shut Kiritimati down in March, 2020.

I know people here are looking forward to a degree of “normalcy.” When I first met Easter, 30, daughter of Timei and Tima, proprietors of the Lagoon View Lodge, I was surprised at her excellent English. I asked what she did to keep busy, and she told me she was taking classes on-line, regarding computer coding. I asked if there was much call for that on Kiritimati? She said no, that she was planning on returning to Honolulu, where she lived.

Easter had come to visit her family on Kiritmati for the holidays in December 2019. As it’s such a distance, she was bringing her 3-year-old to visit his grandparents for a spell, when they got stuck here, unable to leave as air travel shut down due to Covid 19.

Now, six years old, Phillip has spent three years here, half of his life.

When my grandfather arrived here, in June 1916, he was on the lowest rung of the management ladder. I can’t imagine he had a grand plan for advancement, but once the first manager, Malinowski, finally brought his wife and seven children to the island, they were destined to not last four months. One hundred and five years ago if there were 70 or so men on the island, they were probably no more than a dozen women, and even less children. Really not the greatest environment for families at that time.

Which I find ironic, in the clearest definition of irony. Family here is paramount among the I Kiribati. A function of any kind will find a variety of extended family members in attendance. I cannot help but think of how children seem to dominate this island.

Parents look after children, not their own, as if they were. Children run together in packs, as well as holding hands with their best friends, or roughhousing, and playing in every possible way. One cannot miss the kids going to or coming from school walking down the main street, often barefoot, in their neat school uniforms, not just two abreast, but often a half-dozen stretched into the middle of the road.

Teen boys can be seen playing soccer or a pick-up game of basketball, all barefoot and on concrete. Teen girls look after their younger siblings, or hold children of their own.

Back in my grandfather’s day, children on this island were a rarity. White women even more so. Malinowski leaves, and the assistant manager and overseers are promoted, which means my grandfather climbs up a rung. Eventually find himself at the top of the managerial food chain. Then finds himself managing an island devoid of workers: when the contract laborers’s time is up, and he is promised even more workers who never arrive.

My grandfather never knew about the pandemic called the Spanish Flu. Not until it was over. He never knew about the millions of deaths, of the quarantines in every port, of the decimation of sailing crews, of ships not leaving ports around the world. He never knew of the bodies being burned, whole families burned inside their homes on Tahiti, where his boss lived. Never knew the boss’s neighbors — last of the Tahitian royalty — lost a majority of family members, or how ditches in Papeete were filled with the dead.

I find a bizarre parallel in a conversation I have with an I Matang — a foreigner — who has lived here for 25 years. He complains about the mask mandate, here at the height of Covid, noting how few people here got sick at all. In spite of his age and intelligence, he doesn’t see how the island’s isolation — and rapid shut down and quarantine orders going into effect — likely prevented the kind of population loss and devastation that happened to the native population of Labrador, Canada, during the Spanish flu epidemic, when missionaries brought the virus with them. An entire native population was almost lost in that part of Canada.

The I Matang, parroting popular right-wing American news sources, says something about the number of US deaths being equivalent to those who got the flu. I point out to him flu deaths in the US average about 50,000 a year. That would be 100,000 deaths in two years, whereas the United States had 1 million deaths due to a pandemic.

I can’t imagine what it was like here when my grandfather was marooned, having no news on the outside world. In his mind the First World War, the Great War, was still wreaking havoc, even though it ended the year before his rescue.

For myself, it’s now been six weeks with little access to news of the rest of the world, or home. In truth, I find myself not seeking it. Coincidentally, I do see a post asking us to remember where we were when we heard that a former United States president had been indicted on criminal charges, a first in history. I’m certain I’ll very clearly remember where I was. Just as I remember where I was when JFK was shot.

Up until the last batch of nine letters my grandfather received in August, 1918, he would occasionally receive news of the outside world in writing from family and friends, or hear from sailors who came to port, bringing supplies or shipping copra back to Tahiti, and ports beyond.

I’ve probably had a handful of phone calls, as reception is spotty. Maybe a dozen text messages, or messages via Instagram or Facebook. It should be noted that Facebook is huge on this island. It’s huge across the Pacific, with so many family members from this island living elsewhere, whether Australia, Fiji, Honolulu, or even Houston, Texas. Here one doesn’t find the hostility to the application that one does in the United States. On Kiritimati, FaceBook is an integral communication method.

Which reminds me of the fact my grandfather wrote a letter to a woman in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, from London, Christmas Island, asking her to marry him. That’s a story for another day, but I’d like to point out this was long before Tinder, Match.com, or even classified ads in newspapers seeking companions. Two things I learn about my grandfather in this regard: first, he had patience, and second, he was a good writer (according to the woman he was wooing).

His patience finally played out, naked for a year, eating only fish and rice and coconuts. That kind of subsistence diet is eaten by many here. I imagine he eventually longed for a steak or an ear of corn or a potato. More, I imagine he longed for conversation.

It’s when I am on the other side of the island, on the southern peninsula, in what was once Paris, that I realize I am the first English to travel this island on motorcycle. Motorbikes were advocated by the British after they took control of the coconut plantations, in the 1950s. I don’t come to this realization while I am on my motorcycle though. I realize this only when in the backseat of a car driving from Paris to Poland, to help my friend Iou repair his broken motorcycle chain.

I realize that I am now the second English to have driven that same sandy road from Paris to Poland, propelled by a four-wheeled vehicle. I picture my grandfather in one of the two Model-T Fords they had on the island, along with an inordinate supply of gasoline.

I imagine my grandfather, doing those last joy rides from one end of the island to another, over bumpy coral roads, roads hugged tight with thick salt bush, open roads with vistas of uncounted ponds and lakes and lagoons, huge puddles caused by rains or high tides, crabs so thick they cover the road, and driving naked, his clothes, long gone. In spite of his loneliness and isolation and desire to again hold long conversations and fill his belly to his heart’s content, I’ve got to believe there were times he was driving along, naked as the birds around him, and still appreciating the beauty of this place.

I purposely arrived by sea, as that’s how Joe arrived to Christmas Island. I felt compelled that sailing was the only way to properly understand how it must have felt to arrive for the first time. Point of fact, today there has been no other way to arrive over the last three years.

That our vessel was unable to come ashore for four days, due to quarantine issues, with the captain telling me the worst-case scenario would be we would need to continue on to Tahiti, and I would have to leave with them, had me in a bit of a state. Waiting decades to get here, being 400 yards offshore, and not being allowed on land was a test in patience. I know, the “Plan B” of continuing to Tahiti would be “Plan A” for any number of people, but I’m not any number of people and I have not looked at this as a vacation, as sailing was meant as only a means to an end.

Only week ago, I was told to not count on being able to depart according to my scheduled flight, as air travel is still in flux. I had hoped a degree of “normalcy” would return. I’m not alone in that desire.

When I depart by air I will look down and see a view my grandfather could only imagine.

Next time I come here, I’m flying.

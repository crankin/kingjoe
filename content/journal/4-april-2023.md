#### 4:00 PM
#### The Crossroads: A1 & Carver Way

40 km on the odometer, from London. Of course the odometer is also not working correctly. It was 3:30 when I left the agricultural center west of Main Camp. It was 2:30 when I was speaking with Robin. We hadn’t spoken in at least a week. She is well, of course.

#### 68.5 km
#### Poland

Half an hour ago went through a puddle about half a foot deep and bike stopped running. On the horizon there was a fork in the road, to the right skirting around one of the numerous lagoons. three motorcycles ahead of me at that fork. I couldn’t hear them and I guess they could not hear me trying to start my bike. Two ride off towards Poland and the third bike eventually reaches me, although it was not running. It was being pushed by one, with a rider on the seat.

When they stopped, I learned their chain had broken a couple hours earlier. The two brothers were on their way to Main Camp, small bag of copra.

The older brother reminded me we had met just last week, a week ago today.  Then, I was on my way back from the south-east point and stopped when I found a dead tern on the road, the result of my inadvertently riding into a nesting colony on the road a few hours earlier.

Started trying for the longest time to get my bike going, the older brother poking around the battery, the wires. Slim, handsome, I noted his hair had, braided rattail sneaking out from the gap in the back of his ball cap. When I was 24 or 25, I too had a 3” rattail for a spell.

He told me to put the bike in third gear, gave me a running jump-start and I was off. Hated to leave them behind, but they told me this is not the first time they’ve walked back to Main Camp from here.

Now I am on the eastern-most outskirts of Poland. Looking up at the water tank, the house behind it, where Keiti and her husband and children live. I’ll do a sketch because it looks great, an iconic view as you first come in to Poland. Iconic on a small scale I guess.

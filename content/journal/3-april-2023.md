I am sore as fuck. I am reminded by the day and the minute that I’m not the young man I think I am. I wake up, shoulders sore and painful, as if being stabbed to the joints, due to “frozen shoulder.“ An affliction coming less than three weeks before this trip. Certainly something that could not be remedied before the trip, considering the years waiting, and then the years postponed due to the pandemic. Then there was a matter of arriving on the island via sail, and of course, that only happens twice a year.

None of the pain meds worked at all. The steroid pack I took before I left and the one I brought with me and took a month later, absolutely relieved the pain. Most times the pain only troubles me when I am supine, stretched on my back, or side, when I’m trying to sleep. That’s a bit of a conundrum: finding meaningful rest, while very much in pain.

Today when I woke, even my legs were sore and stiff, which is rare. What is not rare is the arthritis in my hands, now to the point where I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to play guitar well again. Unless I switch to playing 100% bottleneck, but that’s not the same.

I can’t even make a solid fist with either hand. My right hand is still well enough to twist a throttle, and my finger dexterity is fine. But my left hand, my fretting hand, always has a numbing pain and dexterity is completely lacking, too often fumbling. Typing is often taxing.

I love a good coincidence. As I’m dictating, I hear my name called and I see it is Iou and his wife, Tabierabwebwe, pulling up to the kia-kia on their motorcycle. I’ve only been to Poland twice before, first time two weeks ago with Iou, the second time days ago with Rodney and Angus. I already know people here and they recognize me. I am the novelty.

Iou, 60, has come to the town clinic for his pain medication. There’s the Coincidence! He talks of being sore after all the manual labor he does as a caretaker at Paris, maintaining the property. I’m 100% certain that’s exactly what happened to me, felling trees, chainsaw and limbs overhead, working the upper back, shoulders and neck for too long. I’m closing in on 65 and dammit, in my mind I’m still 26. Or maybe even 46 or 56. But that’s not reality.

I think of the pain the little girl felt just an hour ago, her dad chasing her with a switch, her mom, smacking her with a plastic bucket. Throwing the bucket at her. The girl in tears.

I saw her a moment ago, in her pristine, red and white outfit, hair done up neatly and beautifully, on her way to school. I watched from afar, as her mother packed her backpack.

I’m off to the primary school, say hello to the teacher, one educator to another. Tell her I plan on sending some books. They are teaching English, and as coincidence would have it, my name is English.

One hundred years ago an English had control of the entire island, had his “neuralgia,” to deal with. I’m not alone in being able to write about the many kinds of pain I’ve felt over the years. Most of which can be imagined, and a couple you might not be able to imagine. I wrote a postcard to my estranged daughter to whom I’ve been sending postcards her entire life, and my hand is in pain as I write, try to scrawl neatly or as neat as I can.

At this moment, I hear some children walking on the road about 30 or 40 yards for me, and I’m not paying attention to them, but I hear the phrase “I Matang,” and I know he is talking about me. It’s now 8:30am and school bells have rung. Time to get going.

Just finished a nice warm water bath along with soap, courtesy of Iou and his big empty cracker bucket. One thing I have to say about the people here, they are always bathing.

We had just finished snorkeling over the reef between Benson Point and Wood Island (where there is no wood), less than 100 yards from where we sleep. The last time I snorkeled over tropical coral was off the Yucatán, on my honeymoon back in 1986. That’s long behind me.

I can’t believe I’ve been here a month and it’s taken me this long to get out over the reef. The other day Rodney told me snorkeling here was good, as he knew I was heading over this way, and he made sure I brought my mask.

I bought a newfangled mask back in January or February, looking for the latest, so I didn’t have to have a damn snorkel in my mouth. Covers your whole face and you can breathe through your nose.

The fish are amazing. I counted at least a dozen species, tiny fish half the size of your thumb, two others a foot or so long. The larger fish are out deeper. For most people, myself included, this kind of view is only seen in a documentary, a Disney film, or a large aquarium in an Asian restaurant. I won’t wait so long until I do it again. The water was chest and shoulder deep. Just warm enough, with the tide slowly on the way in. No waves of any kind to contend with. The beauty made me momentarily forget some of the crap I’ve seen in the past 12 hours.

The crap: at 3 AM a guy comes and sits at the kia-kia where I am sleeping, sitting less than 6 feet away. He starts playing a video game on his phone, the sound, the music, waking me. What the fuck? The guy could be anywhere in the village, places where there is no one around, and he chooses this place? We don’t understand each other’s language, but he understands my tone when I finally speak up the third time. I don’t hear anything, but he is still there, and he finally walks away, under a waxing, full moon.

At dawn, upon awakening, I witnessed child abuse. I wanted to march right over and do something. But it would’ve served no purpose. I will be gone and things will go back to usual. My mother never raised a hand to me. My father? A few times. Enough times to let me know I should stay more than arm’s-length from him. No doubt that little girl was later in one of the primary school classrooms I visited before noon.

Mid morning, I was working on a sketch, to later paint. A group of a half dozen children gathered around me. This has not been unusual. In this case, they all kept telling me hello, and wanting to shake my hand. But I had a pencil in my hand, the other hand, holding my sketchpad. I could not do both. I did try humor them for a moment. Aside from the hellos, I heard the usual chorus of “I Matang!” They pushed and jostled each other, yelling, and I tried to get them to shush, all the while them, still wanting to shake my hand and touch me.

All would shush, but for one loud-mouth, who kept at it, over and over and over. I looked over the village, caught the eye of a couple other adults aware of what was going on. None stepped in. I changed my tone from convivial to irritated, and finally to pissed off. The kid kept goading the others and harassing me. Were it not for a preschool teacher, whom I had met earlier that day, finally intervening, I don’t know what would’ve happened. I haven’t lost my cool in a long, long, long time.

Later, in the mwaneaba, many people were packing and getting ready to load into the empty bed of a truck, to ride into London for Easter weekend. It’s a big deal here. Not only do all have Friday off, but Monday and Tuesday as well. There’s a big choir thing happening in London. All the different village churches, meeting in London.

There is one electrical outlet and I have a converter so I can use the Australian style current. I plug my laptop into that, keep the laptop closed, and then charge my phone with that. This happened to be right next to where a couple and their children essentially live.

While packing my gear, wailing mayhem broke out. I’m used to the sound of children crying on a regular basis in or around the mwaneaba. This time its the young mother whom I had seen two weeks ago, weaving coconut leaf floor mats, while her newborn slept on one. She was in tears and wailing uncontrollably. Squatting down while doing so.

A foot or two from me, she was dressed in her finest, hair up neat. Her two children were packed and ready to go. Husband was one of two brothers I had photographed, along with some other men a couple weeks back. The crying woman was being confronted by an older woman who was berating her. The older woman was very loud, the crying woman was inconsolable and screaming along with her tears.

All others in the mwaneaba, around the perimeter, were aware of what was going on, but kept to themselves. I packed my gear, loaded it, rode to Paris.

If you stay in a place long enough, you are bound witness unpleasant situations, the veneer of an exotic locale, unable to mask reality. These were public displays, with all involved unconcerned how they were viewed. It’s a cultural thing. My own culture tolerates mass shootings in schools, self-serving, criminal politicians, and the list goes on.

Sometimes you get lucky, can rise above the crap. Sometimes, if you are very, very, very lucky, you can wash it all away with a snorkel and water up to your neck.

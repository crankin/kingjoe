### Full Moon Dogs

Walking like a drunken sailor under the moon
sea legs have me rolling in my sleep
A stable bed rolling like my coffin berth
Finally come ashore

Strange dogs bark sniff lie at my feet
Full moon dogs
Full moon dogs go back to sleep
At 4:25 in the morning

Full moon dogs come lie by my feet
Act like they’ve known me forever
Put their paws on my feet new friend
Palms rustle and dog shows his belly and balls

I’m one of them
A full moon dog
Cockerels crow
Back to bed sailor


_[This after two weeks at sea, from Honolulu to Kiritimati, under 30+ kn winds (gale force), and 20+ foot seas. Wobbled when I walked on dry land for a week.]_

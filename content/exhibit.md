on KIRITIMATI, THE REPUBLIC OF KIRIBATI**

You are invited to be part of
## Joe English // Marc English  
## 1916 // 2023

<pre>_____________///|____________________///|____________________///|</pre>

100 years ago, Joe English was on Christmas Island — now Kiritimati — with a camera. He photographed his friends, those with whom he worked, and several natural settings on the island. Then, he was the sole manager of the island’s copra operation. That is, until all the workers left, and he was marooned for almost a year and a half, waiting for a ship with more workers that never arrived.

He was unaware of the pandemic — the Spanish Flu — that kept all boats in port.

More than 100 years later his grandson, Marc English, has returned to Kiritimati, to better understand his grandfather’s journey, as well as learn about the island, and it’s inhabitants, the I Kiribati. That the younger English has been able to witness Kiritimati at the tail-end of a three-year lock-down, due to another pandemic — COVID-19 — and then see the island begin to spring back to “business as usual,” is a rare, once-in-a-lifetime event.

In this exhibit you will see a combination of images taken by both Joe and Marc.

The 1916 images show how life was; the 2023 images show how life is in present day.

In addition to the photographs, there will be reproductions of Marc’s watercolors, an extraction of the 1,270 videos shot, and a sampling from his audio collection which includes everything from choirs singing to a pig snorting.

A special THANK YOU / KO RAB’A to sponsors JMB ENTERPRISES and BETTING TRADING for help with this exhibit and the opening boktaki.

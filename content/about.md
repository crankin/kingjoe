### Who:
Marc English, designer/educator/artist/author

### What:
Currently, under sail on the Sea Dragon, 98’ exploratory vessel. Along with three other passengers, four crew. They head for Tahiti. I get dropped off on Kiritimati.

### When:
Right now.  
February - May 2023, and beyond.

### Why:
In 1919, English’s grandfather, Joe English, was rescued by Admiral Lord Jellicoe, HM Royal Navy after being marooned on the world’s largest coral atoll, due to the Spanish Flu pandemic.

For decades grandson Marc has been entrusted with the family artifacts: grandfather’s photos from 1916 – 2919; copies of his correspondence; details on the cultivation of coconuts (Joe managed  the Central Pacific  Coconut Plantation on the island, barely above the equator, halfway between Hawaii and Tahiti); and the plantation manager’s journal, outlining the contract laborer’s mutiny and attempted murder of Joe.

Now, the younger English – old enough to be grandfather himself – arrives to learn more about the island; the overlapping cultures of the Missionary Catholic and Protestant colonizers; and South Pacific, France, the British Empire, and the United States around which a now-multinational corporation (Unilever) are connected;  the Great War; and a 29-year-old man from outside Boston who has found him all but alone on a desert island – using a false name.

### How:
Now, delayed by another pandemic, the grandson arrives back to Christmas Island — now Kiritimati – as did his grandfather, under sail, upon 20’ seas and all but Gale winds.

Now, with cameras, watercolor and sketch pads, empty notebooks, gifts for the locals, he will spend two months revisiting London, Paris, Algeria, Poland – all named by the defrocked French missionary turned millionaire who leased the island – the debris-strewn shore of the Bay of Wrecks, and finally stand upon the lone 6’ high point of Kiritimati. called “Joe’s Hill,” where a man hiding his past and once boxing champ of the US Navy’s Atlantic fleet, declared himself King of Christmas Island.
